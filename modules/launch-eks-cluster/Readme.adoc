= Launch EKS Cluster

TIP: In this lab you will reference the VPC information, as well as the IAM information in the `IAM Permissions` lab as well as the `Create Your VPC` lab. Make sure you have successfully completed those before attempting this lab.

==== Create the EKS Cluster
[source,bash]
----
aws eks create-cluster \
--name eks-launch-workshop \
--role-arn "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ARN" \
--resources-vpc-config subnetIds=COMMA_DELIMITED_LIST_OF_SUBNETS_FROM_VPC_STACK_OUTPUT,securityGroupIds=SECURITY_GROUP_FROM_VPC_STACK_OUTPUT
----

WARNING: If your IAM user you are using for the CLI does not have administrative privileges, you must explicitly add permissions for that user to call the Amazon EKS API operations.

==== Expected Output
[source,json]

        },

    }
}

==== Cluster Validation
Cluster provisioning usually takes less than 10 minutes. You can query the status of your cluster with the following command. When your cluster status is ACTIVE, you can proceed.
[source,bash]
----
aws eks describe-cluster --name "eks-launch-workshop" --query cluster.status
----

==== Next Module
Your cluster is now deployed and ready to accept commands from you. In the next module, we will download the certificates required to securely log into your cluster.
